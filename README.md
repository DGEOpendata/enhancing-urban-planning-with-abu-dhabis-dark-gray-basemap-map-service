### Abu Dhabi Dark Gray Basemap Service Usage Guide

This guide provides instructions on how to leverage the Abu Dhabi Dark Gray Basemap Map Service for urban planning purposes.

#### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
- **GeoPandas**: Used for handling geographic data. Install it via pip:
  sh
  pip install geopandas
  
- **Matplotlib**: For plotting the maps. Install it via pip:
  sh
  pip install matplotlib
  
- **Basemap Data**: Download or obtain the `Abu Dhabi dark gray basemap` shapefile.
- **Overlay Data**: Obtain additional shapefiles for layers you wish to overlay (e.g., transportation routes).

#### Steps to Use
1. **Load the Basemap**
   - Use GeoPandas to load the basemap shapefile.
   - Ensure that the file path is correct: `path_to_Abu_Dhabi_dark_gray_basemap.shp`.

2. **Plot the Basemap**
   - Use Matplotlib to plot the basemap, setting appropriate colors for clarity.

3. **Overlay Additional Data**
   - Load additional shapefiles, such as transportation routes, using GeoPandas.
   - Overlay them on the basemap for a comprehensive urban planning map.

4. **Visualize the Map**
   - Adjust plot settings such as title, axis labels, and legend to suit your needs.

5. **Analyze and Plan**
   - Utilize the visual map for planning, decision-making, and presentations.

#### Example Code
Refer to the provided Python code to perform the steps above.
